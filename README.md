This is a Python + Streamlit web app created to **automate fair and balanced team drafting** for our annual **Karnival Sukan Lakefront Cyberjaya** basketball tournament (4v4 half-court format).

I started learning Python less than a month ago and decided to turn this local event into a real-world coding project (with a lot of help from ChatGPT 😄).

## 📌 Why I Made This

I love basketball, and this sports carnival has become a tradition in my community.  
I wanted to give back a little – and also build my first **real-world portfolio project** using Python.
